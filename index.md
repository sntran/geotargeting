## Geotargeting

REST API for Google Map data of nearest locations. It takes locations from a 
KML file served by Google Map Engine, and return nearest ones from either an
address or the user's current location.

Requirements
------------
* Node.js v4.0.0+ for ES6 generators support.
* Redis server for caching.

Usage
-----
To run the service, use `npm start`.
Default port is 9876, use `PORT` environment variable to change.
Cache will default to `redis://localhost:6379` if `process.env.DATABASE_URL`
is not defined.

For debug, use `DEBUG=geotargeting:*`.

End points
----------
* `/:map`: the KML file with id `:map`.
* `/locations/:map`: nearest locations in KML data from the
user's current longtitude and latitude based on IP.
* `/locations/:map/:address`: nearest locations in KML data
from the input address. This address is geocoded into long and lat.
* `/locations/:map/:long/:lat`: nearest locations in KML
data from the input long and lat.

Querystring
-----------
Certain queries are supported to deal with JSON response.

* `override`, when set to true, will ignore cache if any.
* `fields` to remove all but specified fields. See `json-mask`.
* `select` for a more advance selector. See `jspath`.
